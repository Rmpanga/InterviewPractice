### Quad Combination Question

Given an array of numbers arr and a number S, find 4 different numbers in arr that sum up to S.

Write a function that gets arr and S and returns an array with 4 indices of such numbers in arr, or null if no such combination exists.
Explain and code the most efficient solution possible, and analyze its runtime and space complexity.


### Detailed RunTime
Sorting + Binary Search
 O(nlog(n) + log(n))

###Detailed Space Complexity
Storing N Values and keys in a HashMap
O(n)
